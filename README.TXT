AI Homework One: Search and Pathfinding
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT TITLE: AI Homework One
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implementing three search algorithms on a grid that contains both passable and impassable paths.
VERSION or DATE: 2/5/2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Jose A. Ortiz
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Running this program simply requires that you specify on the console what .txt file you
                    would like the algorithms to read from. Once you specify a proper file, it will run a search
                    for three search algorithms: Breadth-first, Iterative Deepening and A* search.
